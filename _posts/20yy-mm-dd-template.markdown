### Acknowledgements
Thank you to colleague [Julie Beardsell](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/j.a.beardsell/) for turning the blog inside-out and to her and colleague [Susan Branchett](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/s.e.branchett/) for correcting my English.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
