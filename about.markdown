Lolke Boonstra is ICT Research Expert at the Innovation department of ICT TU Delft.

He has a Doctorate in Mathematics and Informatics. And many years’ experience in networking, security and programming.

These blogs expres the views of the author.

Academic researchers should bother about their research subject and not their ICT needs. I want to collaborate with researchers to solve these needs. This by delivering ICT infrastructures to their laboratory from network to HPC and data sets.

If you have questions, ideas or a problem we can solve together, please don’t hesitate to phone or e-mail me.
